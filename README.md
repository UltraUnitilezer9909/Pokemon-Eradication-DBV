* [Pokémon: Eradication](https://github.com/UltraUnitilezer9909/Pokemon-Alpha-Strike) utilizes the same system (updated to v20.1) and resources from [Pokémon: Crystal Stone](https://github.com/UltraUnitilezer9909/PKMN--CS--ROTFK-discontinued). It features the same story, gameplay mechanics, and more, with new features and improved accessibility. It was created by [Alpha Zetanium XYZ](https://github.com/UltraUnitilezer9909), the same creator of Pokémon: Crystal Stone. The game is set in deep space and revolves around eight different factions based in various countries, including Japan (future), Japan (modern), the USA, the Philippines, the Netherlands, the UK, New Zealand, and Norway.

# **Story/Plot**

In the distant cosmos, deep within a celestial outpost, Pokémon used ancient wisdom to create Xianimon, a powerful entity meant to govern the universe. However, a cataclysmic event shattered their bonds, setting them free to roam the cosmos and spread goodwill.

After a long search, celestial sages found them, hoping to restore their original purpose. But as foretold, Xianimon became conquerors, extending their dominion unchecked. The sages were amazed by their creation's might but were ensnared in its will. The Xianimons surged through galaxies, redefining boundaries, and became the "Xians," sparking a cosmic conflict echoing through Eternity's Chronicles.
